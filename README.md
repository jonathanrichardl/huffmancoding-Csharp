# huffmancoding-Csharp
Huffman Encoding and Decoding complete code that exports the encoded string into a binary file (compressed.bin), and exports the huffman table into a text file (table.txt). Both files are Intercompatible with my huffmancoding-python repository (Meaning that this C# script can decode the strings compressed in by the python script, and can encode the strings and be decoded by the Python Script)
